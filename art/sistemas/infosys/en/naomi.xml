<text>Naomi is an arcade system developed by Sega and released in 1998 to succeed the Sega Model 3 system. Its architecture is very similar to that of the Dreamcast console with a Hitachi SH-4 processor at 200 MHz, a PowerVR graphics processor and sound Yamaha AICA; But with twice as much RAM and video memory. The games are stored on a cartridge or a GD-ROM. It was also designed to work on a network and offer multi-player games. While the Dreamcast had an unfortunate fate, the Naomi system was a success for Sega, the games released were often considered the best.</text>
