<text>The Neo Geo MVS is an arcade system launched in 1990 by the Japanese company SNK. It was marketed as 24-bit and could display a resolution of 320 Ã— 224 in 4096 colors among 65536. The MVS offers arcades the ability to place up to six cartridges in a single terminal, an economic consideration for operators with limited floorspace, as well as saving money in the long-run. The console is strictly identical and named AES. It is known for its quality 2D game library, much of which is fighting games. The exclusives NG-CD were converted into ROM, we lose the original music but we gain some bug fixes.</text>
