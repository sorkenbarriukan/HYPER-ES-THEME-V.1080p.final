<text>3DO, a company created by former members of Electronic Arts, had a universal console project. A partnership was made with Panasonic, Sanyo, Goldstar, each of which could manufacture its own version of the machine. The first 3DO was thus marketed in April 1993. With a 12.5 Mhz processor, 2 MB of RAM and 2 GPU 25 Mhz it could display 320x240 in 16 million colors. At a level slightly lower than that of the Saturn and the PS1 in 3D, it is capable of playing videos in full screen. But there were only a few interesting games made on this medium.</text>
