<text>The Amstrad CPC (Color Personal Computer) is an 8-bit personal computer produced between 1984 and 1990. Based on the Zilog Z80 processor, it was available in 5 models: CPC464, CPC664, CPC6128, 464plus and 6128plus. Several devices were sold, such as a printer, a joystick, a mouse, and a floppy drive. Designed above all for a family clientele, its installation is as simple as possible, and is directly usable even by a layman as soon as the power is turned on. The Amstrad CPC has sold approximately three million copies worldwide, including approximately one million in France.</text>
